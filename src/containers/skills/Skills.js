                    Yes, you knew it was coming. The start to any good project is the time spent just throwing any idea
                    you have out into the world and onto paper. I found that being in an in-person group while
                    brainstorming greatly increased my chances of coming up with a really cool idea. Brainstorming
                    allows everyone to freely suggest ideas. If I was are the closest person to the problem (or the only
                    one), it would be very difficult to come up with new ideas. By inviting others to the conversation
                    and finding new ways, even those who aren't very familiar with the topic can speak up about the
                    ideas that come to mind.

                <p className="greeting-text-points-para paragraph" style={{ color: theme.thirdText }}>
                    And let's be honest, not every idea is gonna be great. In fact, a lot of them are gonna suck. Or
                    maybe they're not feasible at all! Each brainstormed idea does not have to stand on its own. Even if
                    the idea isn't the perfect solution, it's important to express the idea because it can help make
                    something work for someone else. Someone's blurt could be the trigger for someone else's awesome
                    idea. Being fearless in your brainstorming allows for the creation of new ideas and new chains of
                    thought. This can only be successful in a brainstorming session when the floor is completely open to
                    anything.

                    As you can see above, this is some of the brainstorming I did for some of my design projects. These
                    brainstorm sessions ended up producing our final ideas and helped us explore the many options we
                    had. We weren't afraid to put ideas down. For example, when I brainstormed with my group for the
                    chatbot, I initially believed the Covid-19 route was the best. Brainstorming helped me realize that
                    the diet and food topic was a much for interesting avenue for us to take.

                    So as I mentioned before, I'm an artist. This means I think very visually. And that also means I
                    love to sketch and get my ideas out with the use of quick drawings. Something I always hear is that
                    some folks are afraid of sketching because they're "bad at drawing" or my favorite, "I can't draw a
                    stick figure to save my life!!". And well, I have great news. You don't have to be good at drawing.
                    Sketching is a very different skill altogether; if you have a drawing utensil and paper, you're good
                    to go.

                    created for a data visualization project. By sketching out ideas for visualization, I wasn't
                    obstructed by overthinking the actual methods required to create the visual. That's exactly the
                    benefit of sketching! You can freely think{" "}

                    way to show others what you're thinking. Sometimes in brainstorming, it's hard to understand and
                    communicate your idea just with words. Sketching aids and fixes that problem.

                    Researching is key to discovering what is feasible. In brainstorming and sketching, we were able to
                    think with no obstacles. Now it's time to be realistic and discover what has been done before and
                    what technologies and skills are required. Researching can also just involve going out into the
                    world and examining your subject. Research is very project dependent. For example, when I was
                    designing a chatbot, I had zero experience with ever building one. I was given a set of possible
                    options for technologies. I spent some time looking into each one and thinking realistically about
                    their feasibility within our time frame. In the end, we landed on choosing FlowXO for the project
                    even though we later realized there were some drawbacks to the service. This happens; sometimes you
                    make the best choice as the time and it still isn't the perfect option.

                    On the other hand, when I was discovering what areas of Emory's campus were the least or most
                    accessible, I spent real time walking around and investigating. I restricted my use of stairs and
                    any methods of traveling/getting around that was inaccessible.

                    Interaction. Talking to people is key to understanding problems, discovering problems, and designing

                    Additionally, talking to people outside of your design group is something important to do throughout
                    the stages of designing. Feedback is also key to redesigning and updating.

                    One way you can avoid too many social interactions is by using technology to aid your interactions.

                    When I say updating and redesigning, I'm referring to the iterative design process. The iterative
                    process was used throughout the different projects I worked on. The most relevant example of the
                    iterative process is the process we used when designing the mobile website for the Atlanta History
                    Center. First, we started with just prototypes like the ones below.

                    <div

                        <img
                            className="cartoon"
                            src={require("../../assests/images/sketch5.jpeg")}

                            width="700px"

                        <p style={{ color: theme.thirdText }}>prototypes for the ticket page</p>

                <p className="greeting-text-points-para paragraph" style={{ color: theme.thirdText }}>
                    This initial sketch/prototype was our first iteration. I was able to loosely iterate within my own
                    sketches. Next, we created a more official prototype with Figma. This prototype was our second
                    iteration. Our third iteration came when we collected feedback and integrated the feedback into an
                    adjustment for the third iteration. I learned through this process that repeating and reiterating
                    kept improving our design. We were able to hone in on problems we didn't see and flesh out areas we
                    had never even thought of.

                    Additionally, when I was redesigning the airplane seat screen, I also used this iterative design
                    process as you can see in the image below. I took my original sketches and refined them.

                    Learning more about the concepts behind Human Computer Interaction helped me refine my own design
                    process. I was able to take what I learned in class and apply it to my projects. The most satisfying
                    part was that these principles gave the results they promised. By spending time on the iterative
                    process and encouraging ideation, I was able to see improvements in my designs. I hope to continue
                    refining my skills and process as I continue learning more. Here's to creating üç∑.
