                    Yes, you knew it was coming. The start to any good project is the time spent just throwing any idea
                    you have out into the world and onto paper. I found that being in an in-person group while
                    brainstorming greatly increased my chances of coming up with a really cool idea. Brainstorming
                    allows everyone to freely suggest ideas. If I was are the closest person to the problem (or the only
                    one), it would be very difficult to come up with new ideas. By inviting others to the conversation
                    and finding new ways, even those who aren't very familiar with the topic can speak up about the
                    ideas that come to mind.

                    And let's be honest, not every idea is gonna be great. In fact, a lot of them are gonna suck. Or
                    maybe they're not feasible at all! Each brainstormed idea does not have to stand on its own. Even if
                    the idea isn't the perfect solution, it's important to express the idea because it can help make
                    something work for someone else. Someone's blurt could be the triger for someone else's awesome
                    idea. The concept of idea building is to share ideas. This creates new ideas and new chains of
                    thought. Idea formation can only be successful in a brainstorming session if there are no ideas that
                    can be closed immediately. This discourages people from sharing and limits the success of the
                    session.

                    Regular breaks Another advantage of brainstorming sessions is that you get out of your normal
                    routine. Maybe there are no obvious problems that need to be solved by the mechanics of things.
                    However, brainstorming sessions on projects are still useful because they can reveal improvements
                    that you didn't even know you needed.

                    Creating a list At least one person should write down the idea in each session so that the idea is
                    not lost. One of the best parts of leaving a brainstorming session is a list of ideas to pick up and
                    build in the future. Not everything is immediately applicable, but a list of ideas can help you
                    think creatively months after the actual session. cooperation

                    Last but not least, brainstorming creates a team atmosphere. Brainstorming doesn't happen without
                    people. Inviting colleagues to a brainstorming session can help you make sure you're on the same
                    team and open up opportunities to ask others for help.
